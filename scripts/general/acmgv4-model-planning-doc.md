# ACMG / VCI v4 Data Modeling Project Planning  (Jan 7, 2025)

### Approach

Here's my (Larry's) ideas on what parts we need to manage during the model development process.

1. draft class diagram
2. sample data for validation
3. start from top-down and then toggle between bottom-up for specific areas that are well-understood.

4. defer the cspec model if possible, but identify the points of integration so we can come back around at the end.

### Tasks
1. Identify, name, define and associate the *high-level* classes?

2. Identify the data areas/types that need more clarity before we engage in modeling them?
  - this will help provide feedback to the v4 team...(be as specific as possible)
    -- functional
    -- unaffected
    --

3. (later) assist with collaboration on the cspec internal model for the acmgv4 rules that will integrate with the vci



### Target Goal:
  Entity Relationship Diagram of all classes/attributes needed to support the ACMGv4 curation process

  Do we think we have enough information to create the high level class structures?

  Challenge is that we feel as if the Evidence structures/ sub-structures have gaps such that this may not be ready for modeling yet?


  As an Example of what that might look like is...
