manuscript notes

- SPDI should be changed to VCF-style or gnomAD style nomenclature (maybe even beacon). SPDI is not super well known and there should be a more common 2nd type other than HGVS.

- Intro para 4 should probably reference the findings that were collected during the Var Ident section of the NHGRI Fairness workshop in Mar 2025. I think this would be a better reference.\
