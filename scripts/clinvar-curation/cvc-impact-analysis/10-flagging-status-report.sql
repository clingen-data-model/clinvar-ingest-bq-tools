-- CVC Flagging Status Report (by Submitter) -- parameterized table functions
-- =============================================================================
--
-- Purpose:
--   Reports the state of every SCV that CVC has submitted to ClinVar as a
--   "flagging candidate", as of a given ClinVar release date. Each SCV is in
--   one of three states:
--
--     - "flagged submission"         : the flag is applied (rank = -3) in the
--                                      report release.
--     - "removed flagged submission" : the SCV was flagged (rank = -3) at some
--                                      point but is no longer flagged in the
--                                      report release (the flag was removed).
--     - "flagging candidate"         : submitted to and processed by ClinVar but
--                                      never flagged (still pending, or superseded
--                                      by a newer submitter version).
--
--   Reproduces the submitter email-notification columns (SCV | Reason | Notes |
--   Curation date), enriched with submitter id/name, state, lifecycle dates and
--   two "aging" representations.
--
-- Packaging (table functions, so a report_release_date can be passed in):
--   - clinvar_curator.cvc_flagging_status_report_fn(report_release_date DATE)
--       Detail: one row per SCV (analysis-friendly snake_case columns).
--   - clinvar_curator.cvc_flagging_status_by_submitter_fn(report_release_date DATE)
--       Summary: one row per submitter x state, with an aging-bucket matrix.
--   - clinvar_curator.sheets_flagging_status_report_fn(report_release_date DATE)
--       Email-style column names for direct Looker Studio / Sheets consumption.
--
--   report_release_date: any date; snapped to the most recent AVAILABLE release
--   on or before it via clinvar_ingest.schema_on(). Pass NULL for the latest
--   release. (schema_on reflects releases whose data is materialized -- the same
--   universe as clinvar_scvs. Do NOT use clinvar_ingest.clinvar_releases: it is
--   a periodically-refreshed external-table copy that can lag the real data.)
--
-- Looker Studio / Connected Sheets usage (parameter + refresh):
--   Use a Custom Query and expose @report_release_date as a report parameter:
--
--     SELECT * FROM `clinvar_curator.sheets_flagging_status_report_fn`(@report_release_date)
--
--   Changing the control (or refreshing) re-runs the query against the chosen
--   release. Pass a DATE; use CURRENT_DATE() as the parameter default for latest.
--
-- Ad-hoc usage:
--   SELECT * FROM `clinvar_curator.cvc_flagging_status_report_fn`(NULL);
--   SELECT * FROM `clinvar_curator.cvc_flagging_status_report_fn`(DATE '2026-06-27');
--   SELECT * FROM `clinvar_curator.cvc_flagging_status_by_submitter_fn`(DATE '2026-06-27');
--
-- Lifecycle dates (kept distinct):
--   - curation_date        : curator's annotation date. Typically 30-60 days
--                            before the flag-release date (annotate -> 60-day
--                            grace period -> flag appears next release).
--   - batch_accepted_date  : when ClinVar accepted/processed the flagging
--                            candidate (SCV not yet in a release as flagged).
--                            Aging anchor for pending candidates.
--   - first_flagged_date   : the FIRST release containing this SCV's flagged
--                            (rank = -3) record -- the true "date flagged", NOT
--                            the submitted/processed date. Aging anchor for
--                            flagged submissions.
--   - flag_removed_date    : the first non-flagged release AFTER the last flagged
--                            release -- the release the flag was removed. Aging
--                            anchor for "removed flagged submission" rows.
--
-- Aging (both emitted):
--   - days_in_state : days between the report release and the state anchor date.
--   - aging_bucket  : 0-30 / 31-60 / 61-90 / 91-180 / 181-365 / 365+ days.
--   - grace_status  : (candidates) within vs past the 60-day grace window.
--
-- Scope / notes:
--   - Only non-rejected CVC flagging candidates are included, so NCBI-originated
--     flags are excluded.
--   - Deduplicated to the MOST RECENT flagging-candidate submission per SCV.
--   - Submissions listed in clinvar_curator.cvc_flagging_report_suppressions
--     (a manual hide list keyed by scv_id + scv_ver + batch_id) are removed
--     BEFORE dedup, so hiding one batch's submission still lets a newer
--     submission for the same SCV (a different batch) appear.
--   - Two "resolved" categories are INTENTIONALLY EXCLUDED from all output:
--       1. candidates overridden by a newer submitter version
--          (disposition 'never flagged — overridden by new submission version'), and
--       2. flagged submissions intentionally removed via a CVC "remove flagged
--          submission" request (removal_requested_date present).
--     Flags removed for other reasons (e.g. submitter version bump, no CVC remove
--     request) are retained as "removed flagged submission" rows.
--   - `was_ever_flagged` = (first_flagged_date IS NOT NULL). "flagging candidate"
--     rows are always never-flagged; a flag that was applied and later removed is
--     its own state, "removed flagged submission".
--   - "flagging candidate" rows carry a `candidate_disposition` (NULL for flagged
--     and removed-flagged rows). Values that survive the exclusion filter:
--       * 'pending flag (within grace period)'  -- still legitimately awaiting
--       * 'never flagged — past grace, no flag applied'
--                                               -- past grace, still our version
--     ('never flagged — overridden by new submission version' is computed but the
--      rows are excluded upstream, so it never appears in output.)
--   - SCVs that no longer exist in the report release (submitter deleted) are
--     excluded (they are not "removed flagged submissions" -- the SCV itself is
--     gone, not just its flag).
--   - Flagged submissions get `pending_removal` = TRUE when a non-rejected
--     "remove flagged submission" request for the same SCV was submitted on or
--     before the report date but the flag is still applied.
