-- Auto-Reflag Candidates: Flagging Candidate SCVs Needing Re-Flagging
-- =============================================================================
--
-- Purpose:
--   Identifies SCVs that were submitted as CVC flagging candidates but are
--   currently NOT flagged, and where the submitter resubmitted with NO changes
--   to classification, evidence summary (classification_comment), or condition
--   name (trait_set_id).
--
--   This includes SCVs that:
--   - Were flagged (rank = -3) and then lost the flag via version bump
--   - Were NEVER flagged because the submitter bumped the version during
--     the 60-90 day grace period, preventing the flag from being applied
--
--   These are candidates for automatic re-flagging because the submitter
--   effectively "bumped" the version without addressing the underlying issue.
--
-- Scope:
--   Limited to 7 labs known to exhibit this pattern:
--     1. LabCorp Genetics (Laboratory Corporation of America)
--     2. CeGaT GmbH
--     3. Revvity (formerly PerkinElmer Genomics)
--     4. OMIM
--     5. Baylor Genetics
--     6. Counsyl
--     7. Eurofins Clinical Genetics
--
-- Criteria for auto-reflagging:
--   1. SCV was submitted as a CVC flagging candidate (not rejected)
--   2. Only the MOST RECENT flagging candidate submission per SCV is considered
--      (avoids double-counting historically outdated submissions)
--   3. No "remove flagged submission" was accepted AFTER the most recent
--      flagging candidate submission for that SCV
--   4. SCV is currently NOT flagged (current rank != -3)
--   5. SCV is not removed (still exists in current release)
--   6. A version change occurred after the flagging candidate was submitted
--   7. The version change did NOT alter any of the 5 substantive fields
--      (same fields used by version bump detection in 05):
--      - Classification (classif_type)
--      - Submitted classification text (submitted_classification)
--      - Last evaluated date (last_evaluated)
--      - Condition/trait (trait_set_id)
--      - PubMed citations (pmids)
--      - Evidence summary (classification_comment)
--   8. SCV belongs to one of the 7 target labs
--
-- Related:
--   - Prior work documented in clingen-data-model/clinvar-curation-reporting#37
--   - Complements 07-resubmission-candidates.sql (which covers all labs)

-- Target Labs for Auto-Reflagging
-- =============================================================================
--
-- These 7 labs have been identified as having SCVs that were submitted as
-- flagging candidates, then resubmitted with no meaningful changes, preventing
-- or removing the flag. Auto-reflagging is approved for these submitters only.
--
-- NOTE: Submitter name matching uses LIKE patterns to handle variations in
-- naming (e.g., "LabCorp Genetics" vs "Laboratory Corporation of America,
-- LabCorp Genetics"). If a lab is not matching, check the current_name in
-- clinvar_ingest.clinvar_submitters and update the pattern below.
