-- Version Bump and Flagging Candidate Intersection Report
-- =============================================================================
--
-- Purpose:
--   Identifies cases where submitters performed version bumps on SCVs that
--   were submitted as flagging candidates. This helps detect potential
--   "gaming" of the 60-day grace period.
--
--   Key questions answered:
--   1. How many flagging candidate SCVs received version bumps?
--   2. Did the version bump occur during the 60-day grace period?
--   3. Did the version bump prevent a flag from being applied?
--
-- Dependencies:
--   - clinvar_curator.cvc_flagging_candidate_outcomes
--   - clinvar_curator.cvc_version_bumps
--   - clinvar_curator.cvc_batches_enriched
--
-- Output:
--   - clinvar_curator.cvc_flagging_version_bump_intersection
--   - clinvar_curator.cvc_flagging_version_bump_summary
