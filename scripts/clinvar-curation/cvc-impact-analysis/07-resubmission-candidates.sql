-- Resubmission Candidates: Unflagged Flagging Candidates
-- =============================================================================
--
-- Purpose:
--   Identifies SCVs submitted as flagging candidates that should be re-submitted
--   to ClinVar because they are not currently flagged despite meeting criteria:
--
--   1. Past the 60-day grace period with no version change, OR
--   2. Had a version bump (resubmission with no substantive changes)
--
--   This produces an actionable list for re-submission to ClinVar.
--
-- Inclusion Criteria:
--   - Was submitted as a flagging candidate
--   - NOT rejected by ClinVar
--   - NOT currently flagged (rank != -3)
--   - NOT removed (can't re-submit removed SCVs)
--   - AND either:
--     - Had a version bump after batch acceptance → reason: 'version_bump'
--     - OR past grace period with no version change → reason: 'grace_period_expired'
--
-- Exclusions:
--   - Within grace period AND no version bump (still waiting)
--
-- Special Markers:
--   - was_reclassified: submitter changed classification (may need review)
--   - has_remove_flagged_submission: a "remove flagged submission" was submitted
--
-- Dependencies:
--   - clinvar_curator.cvc_flagging_candidate_outcomes
--   - clinvar_curator.cvc_version_bumps
--   - clinvar_curator.cvc_remove_flagged_outcomes
--   - clinvar_curator.cvc_batches_enriched
