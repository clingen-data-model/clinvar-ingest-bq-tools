-- Filtered Views: Excluding Bulk SCV Downgrade Events
-- =============================================================================
--
-- Purpose:
--   These views provide alternate versions of Chart 4 and Chart 5 data that
--   exclude conflict resolutions caused by bulk SCV star rating downgrades.
--
-- Background:
--   Two major bulk downgrade events significantly impacted resolution counts:
--   1. October 2024: PreventionGenetics (submitter_id: 239772) downgraded
--      ~15,000 SCVs from 1-star to 0-star, causing 2,864 conflict resolutions
--   2. July 2025: Counsyl (submitter_id: 320494) downgraded ~4,000 SCVs
--      from 1-star to 0-star, causing 800 conflict resolutions
--
--   These bulk events can skew the visualization of organic resolution trends.
--   The filtered views allow comparing CVC impact against a baseline that
--   excludes these outlier events.
--
-- Identification Method:
--   Resolutions are excluded when ALL of the following are true:
--   - primary_reason = 'scv_rank_downgraded'
--   - snapshot_release_date is in affected months (2024-10-09, 2025-07-06)
--   - At least one contributing SCV in that resolution was from the
--     submitter doing the bulk downgrade (verified via scv_changes join)
