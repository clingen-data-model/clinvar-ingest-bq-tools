# Manuscript Figures

This folder contains SQL scripts that produce the datasets and supporting data for figures included in the forthcoming manuscript describing the ClinVar Curation project.

## Background

The ClinVar Curation project systematically identifies and addresses conflicting variant classifications in ClinVar, with the goal of improving the consistency and clinical utility of submitted interpretations. This manuscript documents the project's methodology, scope, and measurable impact on ClinVar's classification landscape.

Each script in this folder generates a dataset that underpins a specific figure or table in the manuscript. Scripts are numbered in the order they appear in the manuscript.

## Scripts

| Script | View | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `01-clinvar-landscape.sql` | `clinvar_ingest.manuscript_clinvar_landscape` | Per-gene summary of the ClinVar Germline Variant Pathogenicity Classification landscape for genes in the GenCC Definitive/Strong/Moderate (DSM) gene list. Produces total SCV and variant counts, clinically significant (P/LP) variant counts, and a breakdown of aggregate classification categories (concordant P/LP, P/LP vs B/LB, P/LP vs VUS, and three-way conflicts). |
| `02-submitter-landscape.sql` | `clinvar_ingest.manuscript_submitter_landscape` | Per-institution-type summary of ClinVar submitter organizations and their Germline Variant Pathogenicity Classification contributions. Shows submitter counts, SCV counts, and variant counts grouped by institution type (clinical testing, research, expert panel, etc.). |
| `03-flagged-scv-by-consequence.sql` | `clinvar_ingest.manuscript_flagged_scv_by_consequence_view` | Summary of pathogenicity-assessed variants grouped by variation type and molecular consequence category. Shows counts of all variants vs flagged variants across consequence groups (predicted LOF, missense, inframe indels, UTR/intronic, other). Includes SCV-level counts and an audit trail of consequence labels per group. |

## Data Scope

All scripts operate on the **Germline Variant Pathogenicity Classification Submission Data** subset of ClinVar (`gks_proposition_type = 'path'`). This excludes Somatic SCVs and other Germline SCVs that are not pathogenicity classifications (e.g., drug response, clinical impact).

## Dependencies

- **`clinvar_ingest` dataset** - Core ClinVar ingested and temporal tables
- **`clinvar_ingest.gencc_dsm_genes`** - GenCC gene list filtered to Definitive, Strong, and Moderate disease-gene validity classifications
- **`clinvar_ingest.clinvar_genes`** - ClinVar gene records with HGNC IDs, used to bridge `gencc_dsm_genes` (by `hgnc_id`) to `clinvar_single_gene_variations` (by `gene_id`)
- **`clinvar_ingest.clinvar_single_gene_variations`** - Variants mapped to a single gene (excludes multi-gene variants)

## Figure 1: ClinVar Landscape

Script `01-clinvar-landscape.sql` produces data for two scatter plots:

- **Figure 1a**: Conflict count - absolute number of clinically significant conflict variants per gene
- **Figure 1b**: Conflict rate - percentage of variants in clinically significant conflict per gene

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `gene_symbol` | Gene symbol (e.g., BRCA1) |
| `total_scvs` | All pathogenicity SCVs for this gene |
| `total_variants` | Distinct variants with pathogenicity SCVs |
| `total_clinsig_variants` | Variants with P/LP classifications |
| `total_clinsig_conflict_variants` | Variants with agg_sig_type >= 5 (clinically significant conflicts) |
| `concordant_clinsig_variants` | P/LP variants with concordant classifications |
| `clinsig_conflict_pct` | Percentage of variants in clinically significant conflict |

```sql
-- Query the view
SELECT * FROM `clinvar_ingest.manuscript_clinvar_landscape`;
```

## Figure 2: Submitter Landscape

Script `02-submitter-landscape.sql` produces data showing ClinVar contributions by institution type.

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `release_date` | ClinVar release date for this snapshot |
| `type` | Institution type (e.g., clinical testing, research, expert panel) |
| `submitter_count` | Count of distinct submitter organizations |
| `scv_count` | Count of pathogenicity SCVs from this institution type |
| `vcv_count` | Count of distinct variants with SCVs from this type |

```sql
-- Query the view
SELECT * FROM `clinvar_ingest.manuscript_submitter_landscape`;
```

---

## Figure 3: Variants by Molecular Consequence

Script `03-flagged-scv-by-consequence.sql` produces data for two donut charts:

- **Figure 3a**: All pathogenicity-assessed variants by consequence group
- **Figure 3b**: Flagged pathogenicity-assessed variants by consequence group

### Consequence Groups

| Group | Description |
| --- | --- |
| predicted LOF | nonsense, frameshift variant, splice donor variant, splice acceptor variant |
| missense | missense variants |
| inframe indels | inframe insertion, inframe_insertion, inframe deletion, inframe_deletion, inframe indel, inframe_indel |
| UTR/intronic | 5 prime UTR variant, 3 prime UTR variant, intron variant |
| other | All other consequences and variants without MANE Select annotation |

```sql
-- Refresh the data
CALL `clinvar_ingest.refresh_flagged_scv_by_consequence`(NULL);

-- Query the view
SELECT * FROM `clinvar_ingest.manuscript_flagged_scv_by_consequence_view`;
